            <h1>Hostel Profile</h1><br>
            <p>A hostel is a budget-friendly accommodation option typically favored by travelers, backpackers, students, and those on a tight budget. Here's a description covering various aspects:

                Accommodation: Hostels provide shared accommodations, usually in dormitory-style rooms with bunk beds. However, some hostels also offer private rooms for those seeking more privacy.
                
                Facilities: Most hostels offer communal facilities such as bathrooms, kitchens, common areas, and sometimes laundry facilities. Some hostels may also provide extras like breakfast, Wi-Fi, lockers, and luggage storage.
                
                Social Atmosphere: Hostels are known for their social atmosphere, making them ideal places to meet fellow travelers from around the world. Common areas such as lounges or outdoor spaces often facilitate interactions among guests, fostering a sense of community.
                
                Affordability: Hostels are generally much cheaper than hotels or other forms of accommodation, making them attractive to budget-conscious travelers. By sharing facilities and rooms, guests can save money on accommodation costs.<br>
                
                Security: While hostels offer shared accommodations, they also prioritize security. Many hostels have keycard access to rooms, lockers for valuables, and security cameras to ensure the safety of guests and their belongings.</p>
